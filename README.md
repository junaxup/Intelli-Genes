Genome-wide association meta-analysis of 78,308 individuals identified 336 SNPs associated with intelligence.

This script takes your 23andMe raw data and compares your genotype to those found in the paper.

Script requires csv and pandas libraries

Due to size of the 23andMe file, the script can take a few moments to execute. Please be patient.

Note on genetic interpretations: not all SNPs are weighted equally, not all SNPs in the paper are represented due to lack of full coverage by 23andMe, it does not account for heterozygous properties, and it’s still only GWAS correlations that aren’t necessarily causation.
